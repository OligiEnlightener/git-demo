Crank the music up!
Bring that shit in! uggh!
Yeah, the movement's in motion with mass militant poetry
Now check this out, uggh!
In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us
Teaches us to read and right
So called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge
And bow down to their god
